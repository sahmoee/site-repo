# Unified AI, build, and cross-project instructions

This is the single authoritative instruction contract for Codex, Claude, and any other AI or build agent in this repository. Read `README_FIRST.md` first, then read only the sections below that match the current project and task. Legacy instruction filenames link here; do not duplicate rules into them.

## Task routing and updates

1. Identify the current repository and feature boundary before reading or editing code.
2. For UI work, read Product and UI rules; for data/API work, also read Cross-project ownership; for QA tickets, also read QA; for build/release work, also read Validation and publishing.
3. Inspect repository status and preserve unrelated changes. Search for existing implementations and tests before adding another path.
4. Load secrets only from ignored machine-local configuration or Keychain. Never copy values into source, prompts, logs, screenshots, fixtures, or documentation.
5. Default every metered AI request to the lowest-credit supported model and prefer on-device AI when it can satisfy the task. Preserve explicit user/operator model overrides; do not silently promote a default request to a costlier model.
6. When behavior, setup, compatibility, ownership, or validation changes, update the relevant section here and the concise project facts in `README_FIRST.md` in the same verified batch.
7. Shared changes must name an owner, producers, consumers, rollout order, fallback, migration/repair behavior, and verification matrix before publication.
8. Read narrowly to minimize tokens, but never skip a section selected by these routing rules.

## Project and UI rules



Every page, dialog, drawer, and overlay must use the owning product theme without unstyled white surfaces. Layout, typography, controls, and navigation must remain responsive to viewport size, orientation, zoom, safe-area insets, and accessibility preferences. Fixed dimensions are only for intentional media aspect ratios. Avoid overflow locks or scroll containers that trap, clip, or duplicate page scrolling.

## Cross-project ownership and synchronization


- Product truth comes from `stocked`, `StockedMac`, `Atlas`, `Nova`, and `The-Sesh`.
- `UnifiedWorker` and released apps may consume public files such as `content/recipes.json`; preserve schemas and URLs.
- Netlify publishes the Git production branch; Cloudflare supplies DNS.

Update public pages when shipped features, policies, support paths, or confirmed links change. Coordinate consumed-content schema changes with every client first.

## Shared safety, validation, and publishing contract


### Project intake

1. Begin with the named entry point and expand scope only when evidence requires it.
2. State the feature boundary before editing so adjacent shipped behavior is preserved.
3. Identify the authoritative local, server, and generated data sources before changing models.
4. Keep credentials, signing material, user data, and machine-local configuration outside commits.
5. Treat released schemas, URLs, deep links, persistence formats, and extension contracts as compatibility surfaces.
6. Preserve offline/local-first behavior and provide a recoverable failure path for optional services.
7. Apply the complete product theme, adaptive layout, Dynamic Type, accessibility, and device-size contract to UI work.
8. Prefer migrations and retroactive repair over destructive replacement of existing records.
9. Run the narrowest meaningful validation first, then every affected target or consumer.
10. Finish only when behavior, setup, verification, documentation, and cross-project impact agree.

### Implementation and verification

1. Inspect repository status first and preserve unrelated user or agent work.
2. Make the smallest coherent batch that resolves the root cause without silently dropping features.
3. Search for existing abstractions, tests, and generated sources before adding parallel implementations.
4. Never expose secrets in code, logs, screenshots, fixtures, commits, or implementation briefs.
5. Keep public and persisted changes additive unless an explicit, tested migration removes the old path.
6. Update all affected app, widget, extension, Worker, site, and tooling consumers in the same coordinated task.
7. Test empty, loading, failure, offline, cancellation, retry, duplicate, and accessibility states when relevant.
8. Do not publish, deploy, migrate production data, or mark QA resolved after failed validation.
9. Record material decisions and new invariants in the existing short guides without duplicating large documentation.
10. Hand off with changed files, validation evidence, deferred risks, and any required operator action.

### Cross-project delivery

1. Name one owning repository for every shared schema, route, asset, or generated artifact.
2. List every producer and consumer before modifying a shared contract.
3. Preserve older clients with additive fields, tolerant decoding, stable URLs, and routing shims where required.
4. Define rollout order so providers remain compatible before consumers adopt new behavior.
5. Make migrations idempotent, resumable, observable, and safe to retry after interruption.
6. Keep secrets server-side or machine-local and synchronize only names, requirements, and validation—not values.
7. Propagate fixes retroactively to stored records when the invariant applies to old and new data.
8. Validate a matrix covering the owner, direct consumers, extensions/widgets, public content, and fallback paths.
9. Update README-first, AI instructions, cross-project sync, and public documentation in the same verified batch.
10. Retain a rollback or compatibility path until deployed clients and persisted data confirm the new contract.
